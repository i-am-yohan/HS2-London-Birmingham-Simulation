# HS2-London-Birmingham-Simulation
An optimization and simulation project I did for a school project. This simulates a high speed railway line (HS2) between London and Birmingham.
The project can be executed as is and required no external inputs.
The simpy python package is used heavily here to simulate the sustem.
